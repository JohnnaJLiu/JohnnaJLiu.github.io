Hello! I am Johnna Liu. Feel free to call me Johnna or Jiangnan (江南). I am currently a master's student at Cornell Tech, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Volodymyr Kuleshov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/). 

I get lucky to begin my research journey at UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](https://zhiting.ucsd.edu/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Fudan University. I also spent a chill year at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/about/london-business-school/rankings-and-accreditation) before joining Goldman Sachs Investment Banking TMT (Tech, Media and Telecommunication) group as an analyst.

I am interested in generative models, especially discrete diffusion for language tasks.
